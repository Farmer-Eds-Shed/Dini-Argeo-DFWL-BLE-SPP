This project emulates a TruTest S3 livestock weighing scale using an ESP32. It supports both:
- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)** For BLE Apps ( HerdApp)
- **Classic Bluetooth SPP** to send weight data to an Agrident wand

The ESP32 reads serial data from a connected scale (e.g., Dini Argeo) and broadcasts the weight to both protocols.

## üß∞ Features

- ‚úÖ BLE Indicate (UUID: `181D/2A9D`) for HerdApp compatibility  
- ‚úÖ Classic Bluetooth Serial (SPP) for Agrident wands  
- ‚úÖ Fixed 4-digit PIN (`1234`) for pairing  
- ‚úÖ Dual-mode support: BLE and SPP can connect simultaneously  
- ‚úÖ Auto-formats and sends weight data like `21.0 kg`    

## üîå Hardware

- ESP32 (WROOM or similar with classic BT + BLE)
- Scale with serial output (TTL/RS232)

## üì¶ Wiring

| ESP32 Pin | Scale      |
|-----------|------------|
| GPIO 16   | TX (scale) |
| GPIO 17   | RX (scale) |
| GND       | GND        |
| VCC       | AUX VDC    |

**Warning** Level shifting required 5V-3.3V on GPIO 16

## üì° Bluetooth Pairing

- Hard coded **PIN:** `1234` for SPP
- HerdApp connects over BLE
- Agrident connects via SPP (ASCII serial)

## üß™ Example Serial Input

The ESP32 expects data like:
`ST,GS, 21.0,kg`
It extracts `21.0` and sends:
- BLE payload matching Tru-Test S3 spec
- SPP: Passthrough from TTL serial port

## üõ†Ô∏è To Build

1. Use the Arduino IDE
2. Install required libraries:
   - `BluetoothSerial`
   - `BLEDevice` (comes with ESP32 board support)
3. Flash to ESP32
